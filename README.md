Run this in Xcode. Try out your candidate functions in the todo place in code,
replacing my clamp to the value it's at. 

0 degrees is "up", just like the SwiftUI rotation function. 

Here is what the min zoom appears to be shaped like when the aspect ratio between the
view and the picture is a particular way.

x is the rotation in radians, and y is the zoom.
